## about me ##

I am currently a third-year student majoring in Language, Cultures, and Societies of Asia and Mediterranean Africa at Ca' Foscari University in Venice (despite many stereotypes, I don't go to school by boat). 
At the moment, I'm also an exchange student at Hokkaido University for half a year (from April to August).
I have always been deeply passionate about Japan, a passion that was sparked by watching anime when I was a child. This initial interest has since grown into a comprehensive pursuit of knowledge and expertise in this area. Throughout my time at Ca' Foscari University, I have focused on gaining a thorough understanding of the Japanese culture and history (any kind of history), as well as learning the Japanese language (I currently am at level N3), which has been reinforced by my coursework and hands-on projects.
Looking ahead, I don't have any primary goal yet, but I would be quite grateful and happy to be able to translate any type of media from a language to another (right now, the only languages I can speak are Italian, English, and Japanese, but I'm planning to learn more), as I, since I was in elementary school, have been enjoying translating stuff of any kind. 
My primary goal would be to translate stuff that's never been translated before - there are a lot of japanese books, for example, that don't have an english translation - as to improve and expand the knowlegde that one could have.
Aside from my academic hopes and wishes, I have other interests, like listening to music of any kind (with preferences towards rock and metal, but I enjoy anything, really), studying and admiring art (I draw sometimes too, but I'm in no way talented, it's just a silly hobby of mine), consuming any type of media that can give me more knowledge about any kind of topic... and some other stuff. 
I don't have any projects in store yet, I still have to graduate, but I'll see what the future has in serve for me.
