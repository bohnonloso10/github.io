## about me ##

Hi, to you who's reading this.
My name is Francesca and I'm currently a student majoring in Language, Cultures, and Societies of Asia and Mediterranean Africa at Ca' Foscari University in Venice (despite many stereotypes, I don't go to class by boat, neither I have a boat), with my main focus being the Japanese language. 
As of now, I'm also an exchange student at Hokkaido University. 

Having watched a lot of animes and animated movies in general since a really young age, I've always been curious about Japan and its culture, and that was an interest that would exponencially grow with the passing of the years and my discovery of the interet world. 
Because of this, I decided that I wanted to learn the Japanese language at all costs, as well as getting more familiar with the Japanese culture and history (from arts to actual history and much more), something that I've been able to do throughout my time at Ca' Foscari: my university offers a ridiculously large amount of courses about any kind of field related to Japan, and I believe the Japanese courses in there are the best overall in all of Italy. 

Looking ahed, I don't have any particular goal yet: right now what I want to achieve the most would be graduating and maybe getting an N2 certification (I'm currently at level N3), but that could change in the future. Overall, I think I would like to put what I studied throughout my university career at use, but I still haven't figured out how. 

Aside from my academic hopes and wishes, I have other interests, like listening to music of any kind (with preferences towards rock and metal, but I enjoy anything, really), studying and admiring art (I draw sometimes too, but I'm in no way talented, it's just a silly hobby of mine), consuming any type of media that can give me more knowledge about any kind of topic... and some other stuff. 

I don't have any project in store yet, neither I have anything university-study related to put here, that's why, for now, i will just use this github page as a diary of my travel in Japan, hoping to give advices or good recommendations to other people who are coming here/would like to come here, either as students, workders, or tourists. 
So pleas, bear with me for the time being.
Thank you.
